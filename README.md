🧠 Namaste DSA - Daily Coding Exercises

Welcome to my repository of daily coding solutions based on the Namaste DSA series by Akshay Saini. This repository is my personal journey to strengthen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, one problem at a time 💪.


---

📅 Goal  

To build strong DSA foundations by solving problems from Namaste DSA, with consistent daily practice and implementation in JavaScript.


---

📂 Folder Structure

Each file inside the Warm-Up or other relevant folders contains:

A specific problem based on DSA concepts covered in the series.

JavaScript code with comments (where necessary) for better understanding.

Most filenames follow the pattern: 01-ifelse.js, 02-loops.js, etc., matching the episode or exercise number.
